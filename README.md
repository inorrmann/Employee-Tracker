This interface allows companies to view and manage their departments, roles, and employees.

Users can input:
* employees
* roles
* salaries
* departments

Users can view the data entered in by:
* all employees
* employees by department
* employees by manager
* all roles
* all departments

They can also remove employees, roles, and departments, and update the role or the manager of employees.

As an added bonus, users can also view the total budget of a department (i.e., the combined salaries of all employees in that department).
